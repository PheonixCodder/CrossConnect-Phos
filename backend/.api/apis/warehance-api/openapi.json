    "description": "The Warehance API provides programmatic access to Warehance's inventory, order, and shipment management services. It is designed for small to medium-sized brands and 3PLs, enabling robust automations, comprehensive order management, inventory management suites, batch shipping, zone picking, carrier connection integrations, and dynamic rate shopping. The API supports integration with various marketplaces and carriers, allowing seamless scaling of warehouse operations across multiple locations.\n\n## Authentication\n\nTo securely interact with the Warehance API, you must authenticate your requests using an API Key. Below are the steps and guidelines to properly authenticate your API requests.\n\n### 1. Obtaining an API Key\n\n1. **Log in to Warehance:**\n    - Navigate to [Warehance](https://app.warehance.com/) and log in with your credentials.\n\n2. **Navigate to API Settings:**\n    - Once logged in, go to the **Settings** section located in the sidebar.\n\n3. **Generate API Key:**\n    - In the **API Keys** subsection, click on **Generate New API Key**.\n    - Provide a meaningful name for the API Key to identify its usage (e.g., \"Production Key\" or \"Development Key\").\n    - Click **Generate** to create the API Key.\n\n4. **Store API Key Securely:**\n    - **Important:** Copy the generated API Key and store it in a secure location. This key will not be shown again for security reasons.\n    - **Do not** expose your API Key in client-side code, public repositories, or any unsecured environment.\n\n### 2. Including the API Key in Requests\n\nAll API requests must include the API Key in the request headers to authenticate and authorize access.\n\n- **Header Name:** `X-API-KEY`\n- **Header Value:** Your unique API Key\n\n**Example Request:**\n\n```http\nGET /orders HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.warehance.com\nX-API-KEY: your_api_key_here\n```\n"
